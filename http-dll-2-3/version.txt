Http Dll 2.3 release 6

--------------------------------------------------

2.3 release 6
- fixed incorrect help string for socket_connect in GM Studio extension

2.3 release 5
- fixed bug in buffer_write_hex (regression from 2.3 release 3)

2.3 release 4
- removed state_shutdown: socket_shut_down now sets an internal flag, the state stays the same, this means socket_shut_down can now be called in states other than state_connected (the numbers for other states stay the same for backward compatibility)
- the socket isn't destroyed anymore when the other side shuts down, this means you can still write data in state_closed (important for HTTP servers)
- HTTP requests now wait until the server closes the connection before shutting down the socket (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8855804/http-shutdown-socket-for-writing-after-sending-the-request)

2.3 release 3
- added buffer_read_base64 and buffer_write_base64
- added httprequest_urldecode
- some internal changes

2.3 release 2
- added argument to listeningsocket_start_listening to create a local listening socket (which doesn't accept external connections, avoiding firewall warnings).

2.3 release 1
- added RC4 encryption
- added zlib compression
- added functions to read part of a file and append to a file

The changes below are not 100% accurate. The list is based on old forum posts.

2.2
- added UDP functions
- split socket_update into socket_update_read and socket_update_write

2.1
- changed some function names
- functions are now more tolerant to programmer errors
- new reset functions for http requests and sockets
- new data type (intv/uintv) which is now used by the message system, making this version incompatible with previous versions
- added SHA-1

2.0
- everything was rewritten from scratch, there are too many differences with Http Dll 1 to name them.
